This tool saves you time by eliminating the need to:

1. Travel from your hideout to Kingsmarch and wait for loading.
2. Spend several seconds walking to talk with Tujen.
3. Drag the slider five times.
4. Finally calculate the total value of your crops.

For me, the above process takes about 10 seconds. With this tool, it takes only 3 seconds max:

1. Talk to Johan in your hideout and open the Town Map.
2. Take a screenshot of your crops.
3. Click the 'Paste Image' button.
4. Get the total value of your crops.
